# Incident Handling

> "I think the first things any org can and should do is to establish some boundaries/restore a safe environment, regardless of the veracity of the allegations. Take care of things privately first, talk to the victims and maybe alleged perpetrators, and ensure that they don't come into contact. This is something orgs can do in all cases, and likely won't touch legal grounds."

So something happened. Or maybe you've "heard" something happened. There is reasonable belief that harm was incurred. Certain words are being thrown about. What do you do?
